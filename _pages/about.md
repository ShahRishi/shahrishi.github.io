First-year medical student at Boston University with a background in computer science. My work focuses on applying machine learning to healthcare. I've built clinical NLP systems for ophthalmology at Mass Eye and Ear, developed language models trained on millions of clinical notes, and worked on ML-driven drug discovery at Iambic Therapeutics and Belharra. I'm interested in building tools that actually make a difference in clinical and research settings.
